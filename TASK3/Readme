It contains a multi container set up
-> Node cjs app running on port 5000
-> Mongo DB database which stores data

I used compose.yaml file thus the cintainers formed run on the same network [a default network given by compose or docker]

[ docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d ] used to up or start the container and image

SO THATS HOW IT WORKS

THANK YOU
